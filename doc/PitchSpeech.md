In most ponds 80% of the waste comes from ducks alone.

That means murky water, algae overgrowth, and a struggling ecosystemâ€”all because of one species.

In fact duck infested waters are so dirty, the bacteria concentrations exceed European Union standards for bathing waters.

Would you want your children to swim in such waters?

Lets make our lakes clean again!

Getting rid of all ducks would also benefit our farmers greatly.
Research from Oregon State University revealed that their even more evil siblings the geese, are responsible in up to a 25% reduction in winter wheat yields in certain areas, by eating the crops.

Now we know that, a lot of people here share a big sympathy for ducks. Who would blame them? Those Foul-feathered freaks hide their egoist and malicious reality behind a cute and pleasant to look at appearance.

Only our duck shaped robot can save our nature.
Save our farmers.
And let our children swim in peace again.

It keeps the pleasant look of ducks while producing zero waste.
Eating zero crops.
And harassing zero people.

Finally children can feed ducks again without supporting a terror regime.

And there is no compromise in pleasant and alive looking, but also clean parks anymore.

Let us end this tyranny now once and forever!
