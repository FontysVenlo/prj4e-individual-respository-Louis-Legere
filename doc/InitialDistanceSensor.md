Here I just tried out the distance sensor, before integrating it into the whole system just so I can get familiar with how it operates:

And luckily it did work and actually displayed the distances:
![Distances](images/Distances.png "Distances")
Getting it to work was not a big issue and only uses simple physics calculations.
