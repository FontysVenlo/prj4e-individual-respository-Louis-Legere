**LO1:** Student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way

**In my own words:** I want to build a duck shaped robot while focusing on two main activities: Design in Hardware Interfacing and Realisation in Software. Level 2 of the HBO cube would include integrating a hardware interface and including security and system performance to also ensure real time aspects.
// learning goal -> ambition -> plan!!
// miss my abition what I want to learn
// there is a uml cys ml for embedded systems
//other development methods
// maybe I wanna focus on the testing of embedded systems
// maybe control algortihms
// maybe ill dive into vision
//object detection
// real time distance detection

**Plan:** 
// I can link youtube videos I used for help for certain prj parts
// also OSCO and INES

Week1:  Week1 was basically just brainstorming for a project idea.

Week2: In Week2 we narrowed the ideas down and developed a more precise understanding on what each idea would mean.

Week3: In Week3 we decided on the duck robot as the idea that will be build.

- [Initial Project Idea](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e02/blob/main/doc/initial-project-idea.md)

Week4: We made the duck idea more clear and started to formulated what the duck has to be able to do. 

Week5: In week 5 I mainly researched into components and chose several. I focused on the Speaker, compass, step down converter, distance sensor and micro controller. Although they had to be changed later. Also I had to find a way to store sound files.

Week6: I prepared, worked on and held the pitch 
 - [Pitch Speech](/doc/PitchSpeech.md)

Week7: In week 7 I have changed quite some components from the component list since they turned out to be suboptimal. Therefore the speaker and SD card reader changed to a sound module that combines both and will be easier to operate.

**LO2:** Student demonstrates professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented
organisation, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted
interaction.

**In my own words:** I want to consider future oriented organisation, develop my investigative ability by analysing important issues, extend my personal leadership with constantly extending my own knowledge independently and apply targeted interaction implementing a proper group communication.

// not precise enough and what exactly I want to improve
// I want to be more relaibl or on time
// taking initiative
// I want to broaden my investigate ability with papers books collegues 
// personal leadership -> become scrum master or product owner
// 360 degree feedback
// did I make a plan and where I able to follow the plan 
// proof by feedback
// make graphs of my github assignment handins

// here its more convince than proof
