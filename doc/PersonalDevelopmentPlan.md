**LO1:** Student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way

**In my own words:** I want to build a duck shaped robot while focusing on two main activities: Design in Hardware Interfacing and Realisation in Software. Level 2 of the HBO cube would include integrating a hardware interface and including security and system performance to also ensure real time aspects.

**Plan:** 

Week1:  Week1 was basically just brainstorming for a project idea.

Week4: We made the duck idea more clear and started to formulated what the duck has to be able to do. 


**LO2:** Student demonstrates professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented
organisation, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted

**In my own words:** I want to consider future oriented organisation, develop my investigative ability by analysing important issues, extend my personal leadership with constantly extending my own knowledge independently and apply targeted interaction implementing a proper group communication.
