**LO1:** Student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way

**In my own words:** I want to build a duck shaped robot while focusing on two main activities: Design in Hardware Interfacing and Realisation in Software. Level 2 of the HBO cube would include integrating a hardware interface and including security and system performance to also ensure real time aspects.


### Ambition
After this project I want to be able to implement object detection into a embedded machine using a distance sensor. I also want to develop a motion algorithm that keeps the robot swim in a straight line and to turn when real time detecting an object ahead. 
I also want to be able to model and plan embedded systems after this project
// learning goal -> ambition -> plan!!
// miss my ambition what I want to learn
// there is a uml cys ml for embedded systems
//other development methods
// maybe I wanna focus on the testing of embedded systems
// maybe control algortihms
// maybe ill dive into vision
//object detection
// real time distance detection

**Plan:** 
// I can link youtube videos I used for help for certain prj parts
// also OSCO and INES

Week1: Week1 was basically just brainstorming for a project idea.
- [Image of all initial project ideas](/doc/InitialProjectIdeas.md)
I also did the first c exercises, which can be found in the [INES-REPO](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/ines-course-exercises-Louis-Legere).

Week2: In Week2 we narrowed the ideas down and developed a more precise understanding on what each idea would mean.

Week3: In Week3 we decided on the duck robot as the idea that will be build. 
- [Concept art of the duck](/doc/ConceptArtDuck.md)
- [Initial Project Idea](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e02/blob/main/doc/initial-project-idea.md)

Week4: We made the duck idea more clear and started to formulated what the duck has to be able to do. 

Week5: In week 5 I mainly researched into components and chose several. I focused on the Speaker, compass, step down converter, distance sensor and micro controller. Although they had to be changed later. Also I had to find a way to store sound files.
- [ComponentList](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e02/blob/main/documentation/GreatComponentList.md)

Week6: I prepared, worked on and held the pitch 
 - [Pitch Speech](/doc/PitchSpeech.md)

Week7: In week 7 I have changed quite some components from the component list since they turned out to be suboptimal. Therefore the speaker and SD card reader changed to a sound module that combines both and will be easier to operate. 

prjWeek1: In the first project week I have set up a basic structure for the application, creating different threads for different components that have to work separately of each other. One of them is the sound Module. It needs to be on its own thread, so it does not stop making sound once some other component is getting operated. 
- [Completion of the sound behaviour](/doc/SoundModule.md)
I also began testing out the distance sensor. To do so I just put it on a breadboard separately.
- [Initial test of the distance sensor](/doc/InitialDistanceSensor.md)


prjWeek2: Since most of the components did not arrive in time we could unfortunately not work effectively in the second project week. However the decoy duck did arrive and I started preparing the frame by cutting an opening into the duck. 
We also tested out how high the waterline would be for the final duck robot in water, by putting the approximate weight into the duck and letting it float.

Week8:


**LO2:** Student demonstrates professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented
organisation, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted
interaction.

**In my own words:** I want to consider future oriented organisation, develop my investigative ability by analysing important issues, extend my personal leadership with constantly extending my own knowledge independently and apply targeted interaction implementing a proper group communication.


### Ambition
After this project I want to extend my personal leadership in a way where always hand in assignments on time and still try to broaden my knowledge independently from university in a self driven way.
In terms of group work I want to to take more initiative and have an notable impact on the whole project. Therefore I need to know about all the different aspects of the project improving my investigative ability.
// not precise enough and what exactly I want to improve
// I want to be more reliable or on time
// taking initiative
// I want to broaden my investigate ability with papers books colleagues 
// personal leadership -> become scrum master or product owner
// 360 degree feedback
// did I make a plan and where I able to follow the plan 
// proof by feedback
// make graphs of my github assignment handins

// here its more convince than proof
**Plan:**

To apply future oriented organisation during our project we held daily stand-up meetings. The role of the chairman switched every day in order to develop the personal leadership of every group member. We also used the Kanban board and moved the tickets that changed status after every stand-up meeting.

Week7:

prjWeek1: In the first project week Ben designed the waterwheel model to 3d-print it. So this one I did not do personally, but we went together to the green-tech lab to targetly interact with them in order to find out how to print it in the best way and what to look out for. I think this also counts as future oriented research since this was only the first try for printing anything and not even the final wheel design. If you want to find out what I learned from that click [here](/doc/WhatDidILearnFromAskingTheGreenTechLabGuys.md).

prjWeek2:

Week8: To improve the future oriented organisation we held a mid term reflection meeting to reflect on the state of the project and the efficiency of our work.

prjWeek4: I informed myself about real time in computing reading this article: https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/embedded-systems/0/steps/64783
